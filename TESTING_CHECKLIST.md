### ‚úÖ Performance Testing
- [ ] Page load times are acceptable (<3 seconds)
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Images and assets load quickly
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors

### ‚úÖ Data Integrity Testing
- [ ] User progress saves correctly across subjects
- [ ] Subject progress calculations are accurate
- [ ] Learning path completion tracking works
- [ ] Question responses save properly
- [ ] No data loss during navigation

## üöÄ Quick Test Commands

### Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### Check for TypeScript Errors
```bash
npm run build
# or
pnpm build
```

### Test Database Connection
1. Go to `/dashboard`
2. Check browser console for any Supabase errors
3. Verify data loads correctly

### Test Multi-Subject Flow
1. Go to `/dashboard`
2. Click "All Subjects" tab
3. Click on a subject card
4. Verify navigation to `/learning?subject=<name>`
5. Click "Start Learning" or "Continue"
6. Verify learning path loads

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No subjects found"
**Solution**: Run the Phase 1 database script to create subjects table

### Issue: "Learning paths not loading"
**Solution**: Check that learning_paths have subject_id values set

### Issue: "TypeScript errors"
**Solution**: Ensure all new type definitions are imported correctly

### Issue: "Navigation not working"
**Solution**: Check that all route files exist and are properly configured

### Issue: "Styling issues"
**Solution**: Verify CSS custom properties are defined and Tailwind classes are correct
