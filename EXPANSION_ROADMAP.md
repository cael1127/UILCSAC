## 🚀 Quick Start Implementation

### Step 1: Database Setup
Run these scripts in your Supabase SQL Editor in order:

```sql
-- 1. Core multi-subject expansion
scripts/phase1_multi_subject_expansion.sql

-- 2. Math UIL content
scripts/phase2_math_content.sql

-- 3. Science UIL content
scripts/phase2_science_content.sql
```

### Step 2: Update Your Codebase
The following files have been created/modified:

**New Files:**
- `lib/types/subjects.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `components/multi-subject-dashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard
- `app/learning/page.tsx` - Subject-filtered learning page

**Modified Files:**
- `components/learning-paths.tsx` - Added subject filtering
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Integrated multi-subject dashboard

### Step 3: Test the Implementation
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/dashboard`
3. Click on "All Subjects" tab
4. Verify you see cards for all 5 subjects
5. Click on a subject to view its learning paths
