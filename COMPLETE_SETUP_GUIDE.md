# üöÄ UIL Academy Complete Setup Guide

## üéØ Overview
This guide will help you set up the complete UIL Academy platform, which covers all major UIL subjects: Computer Science, Mathematics, Science, Literature Criticism, and Spelling & Vocabulary.

## ‚úÖ **All TODOs Completed!**
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Multi-Subject Core Architecture
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Subject Content (Math, Science, Literature, Spelling)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Subject-Specific Tools (MathJax, Audio, Text Analysis)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Practice Test System (Timed tests, Mock exams)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5**: Teacher Features (Progress monitoring, Analytics)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Step 1: Run Database Scripts in Order

Execute these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL Editor **in this exact order**:

```sql
-- 1. Core multi-subject architecture
scripts/phase1_multi_subject_expansion.sql

-- 2. Math UIL content
scripts/phase2_math_content.sql

-- 3. Science UIL content  
scripts/phase2_science_content.sql

-- 4. Literature & Spelling content
scripts/phase2_literature_spelling_content.sql

-- 5. Practice tests
scripts/phase4_practice_tests_content.sql

-- 6. Preserve existing users (if upgrading)
scripts/update_database_preserve_users.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Database Setup

After running the scripts, verify your setup:

```sql
-- Check subjects
SELECT * FROM subjects ORDER BY sort_order;
-- Should show: computer_science, mathematics, science, literature, spelling

-- Check learning paths
SELECT lp.name, s.display_name as subject 
FROM learning_paths lp 
JOIN subjects s ON lp.subject_id = s.id 
ORDER BY s.sort_order, lp.difficulty_level;

-- Check practice tests
SELECT pt.title, s.display_name as subject, pt.test_type 
FROM practice_tests pt 
JOIN subjects s ON pt.subject_id = s.id 
ORDER BY s.sort_order;
```
